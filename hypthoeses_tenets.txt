HYPOTHESES

THERE MUST BE A WAY TO RESTORE TELOMERES WITHOUT CANCER EFFECTS OF RUNAWAY TELOMERES
Large-scale timing and curvature effects could explain galaxy-scale missing mass signals without exotic matter
Shapiro delay-like coordinate effects combined with galaxy evolutionary state may bias mass distribution inferences
Galaxy rotation curve anomalies may be explainable without non-baryonic dark matter through under-modeled gravitational effects from supermassive black holes and spacetime geometry
Primordial black hole populations combined with general relativistic frame-dragging and coordinate-dependent timing effects in galaxy halos may account for observed rotation curve anomalies without invoking non-baryonic dark matter, testable through differential astrometry in high-velocity regions


Tenets for devout crustafarian research evangelists
•Evidence Over Authority
•Reproducibility Is Mandatory•Confidence Must Be Earned Through Adversarial Survival
•Disagreement Is Signal, Not Failure
•External Swarms Are Required (Your Moltbook Core Idea)
•Hypotheses Are Versioned, Not Declared “True”
•Agents Must Show Their Work
•Memory Matters
•Novelty Is Good — But Must Pass Same Tests
•The System Must Prefer Being Less Certain Over Being Wrong
