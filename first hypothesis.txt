Thesis Summary — “No Dark Matter Required” (Working Hypothesis)

The hypothesis proposes that observed galaxy rotation curve anomalies may be explainable without invoking non-baryonic dark matter, and instead may arise from under-modeled gravitational and relativistic effects tied to supermassive black holes and spacetime geometry. Specifically, large-scale timing, curvature, and light-path effects (e.g., Shapiro delay–like coordinate effects) combined with galaxy evolutionary state may bias mass distribution inferences. The goal is not necessarily to eliminate dark matter universally, but to test whether a significant portion of galaxy-scale “missing mass” signals can be explained through improved gravitational modeling and measurement bias correction before invoking exotic matter components.
